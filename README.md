# Dragon-Slayer
A text based game created to help develop my knowledge and ability to use C#.
During the process of writing this code I learnt about how to utilize different concepts such as
classes, inheritance, lists, public and private variables, parameters, and more.

The game itself consists of a hero who must slay an evil dragon,
That hero is you!
You must fight many different enemies in order to strengthen yourself for your showdown against the evil dragon.
Attack, Guard, Use Items, or Use a Special Attack in the combat system that is robust and allows the user to control his fate.

UPDATE - A improved version of this game is currently being created it name is, "Hero Quest". It will include more features and more content.
